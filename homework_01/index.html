		Preformatted Text

		Text
		  in a pre element
		    is displayed in a fixed-width
		font, and it preserves
		both           spaces and
		    line breaks

		Code

		.wrapper {
		  display: grid;
		  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
		  grid-gap: 10px;
		  grid-auto-rows: minmax(100px, auto);
		}

		Blockquotes

		Let’s keep it simple. Italics are good to help set it off from the body text. Be sure to style the citation.
		Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them.
		            
		Steve Jobs

		And here’s a bit of trailing text.
